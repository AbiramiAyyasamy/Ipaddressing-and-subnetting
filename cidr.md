## CIDR:

A system called Classless Inter-Domain Routing, or CIDR, was developed as an alternative to traditional subnetting. The idea is that you can add a specification in the IP address itself as to the number of significant bits that make up the routing or networking portion.

## CIDR NOTATION
The CIDR number is typically preceded by a slash “/” and follows the IP address. For example, an IP address of 131.10. 55.70 with a subnet mask of 255.0. 0.0 (which has 8 network bits) would be represented as 131.10.

**how do yoy read CIDR Notation?**

In CIDR notation, IP addresses are written as a prefix, and a suffix is attached to indicate how many bits are in the entire address. The suffix is set apart from the prefix with a slash mark. For instance, in the CIDR notation 192.0. 1.0/24, the prefix is 192.0.
